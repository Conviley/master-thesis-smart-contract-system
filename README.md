# Availability of Smart Contracts That Rely on External Data
This repository contains the smart contract system built for the master's thesis conducted by Tjelvar Guo and Daniel Herzegh at Link√∂ping University 2020.  
The accompanying Master's thesis report is published and can be read at[TODO: ADD LINK]()  
The remaining part of this readme will detail how to conduct the research experiments performed by the authors.

# Pre-requisites
1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install Truffle: `npm install -g truffle`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` and then `cd client ; npm install`
4. In the root of the repo create a file called `.secret` and paste your wallet seed phrase inside
5. Setup ethereum client node for the `ropsten network` running on `loclhost:8546`. To replicate the work of the authors setup a [Geth node](https://geth.ethereum.org/downloads/).
6. Deploy Contracts: `truffle migrate --network ropsten` make sure to note the deployed address of DeRail!
7. In the root of the repo create a file called `address.json` and paste the contract address into it as the following
```json
{
  "address": "YOUR_DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"
}
```
8. Setup Chainlink node. Please refer to the [official chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/node-operator-overview)
The authors hosted their Chainlink node on Google cloud with the settings found in appendix **A** of the master thesis report.
9. Create a developer account at https://api.trafikinfo.trafikverket.se/ and generate an API-key.
10. Deploy the external adapter. Copy the code in the folder 'external adapter'. Deploy it locally or as a serverless function on some VPS. Either set the 'key'-variable to your API-key or include the API-key as an environment variable. 
11. Connect the Chainlink node to the external adapter with a so called 'bridge'. Follow the instructions here: https://docs.chain.link/docs/node-operators#config.


You need ETH in your `ropsten` wallet and your contract needs LINK!

# Testing
Once every prerequisite is setup and ready you may proceed to run passenger and chainlink tests
## Passenger tests
To run passenger tests specify desired parameters in `passengerTest.js` and run it with node. 
## Chainlink tests
Before running the chainlink test make sure that your chainlink node is online.  
In `chainlinkTest.js` you may specify desired parameters. Make sure that the trip information is up to date and that a trip with that data exists, since trafikverket flushes out old data quite regularly. To start the chainlink test run `chainlinkTest.js` with node
